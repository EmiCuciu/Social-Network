# Social Network
 This is the lab project for Advanced Programming Methods during the semester 3.
I chose to make this project in the style of a social networking application for the mafia family.🧐🕵️‍♂️

This is how it look like when you run the program, this is the Login menu:

Here we have the SignUP menu. Here you can join in the mafia family 😃:

Your profile is presented here, after you log in.

There are several tabs where you can see your mafia friends, another tab where you can send them messages.

You can also see all the users and you have the possibility to see notifications in case someone wants to become your brother🥂.

# The project is structured on the layered architecture pattern, with data persistence in the database.🗄

I hope you enjoy it.😎
